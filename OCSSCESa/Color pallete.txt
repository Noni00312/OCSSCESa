A 60-30-10 color palette is a classic design rule used to create balanced and visually appealing color schemes. It breaks down as follows:

60%: Dominant color (used for the background or main areas).

30%: Secondary color (used for supporting elements).

10%: Accent color (used for highlights and emphasis).

For a voting system, you want a palette that feels professional, trustworthy, and user-friendly. Since you want to include maroon as the accent color, here's a suggested palette:

Color Palette for a Voting System
1. Dominant Color (60%)
Light Gray (#F5F5F5 or #E0E0E0)

A neutral, light gray provides a clean and professional background that doesn't overwhelm the user.

It ensures readability and keeps the focus on the content.

2. Secondary Color (30%)
Navy Blue (#2C3E50 or #34495E)

Navy blue conveys trust, stability, and professionalism.

Use this for headers, buttons, or other supporting elements.

3. Accent Color (10%)
Maroon (#800000 or #8B0000)

Maroon adds a touch of sophistication and warmth.

Use this for call-to-action buttons, highlights, or important icons.

How to Use the Palette
Background (60%):

Use light gray for the main background of your application.

This ensures the interface feels clean and uncluttered.

Secondary Elements (30%):

Use navy blue for navigation bars, sidebars, or card backgrounds.

This creates a strong visual hierarchy without being too distracting.

Accent Elements (10%):

Use maroon for buttons, icons, or other interactive elements.

This draws attention to key actions, such as "Vote" or "Submit."

Example Usage in a Voting System
Here’s how you can apply the palette:

1. Background (Light Gray)
The main screen where users view candidates or voting options.

2. Secondary (Navy Blue)
The header bar with the title "Voting System."

Cards or containers for candidate information.

3. Accent (Maroon)
The "Vote" button.

Icons or indicators for selected candidates.

Additional Tips
Contrast: Ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for readability.

Whitespace: Use ample whitespace to keep the interface clean and easy to navigate.

Typography: Pair the color palette with a modern, sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) for a professional look.

Alternative Accent Colors

Gold (#FFD700): Adds a luxurious touch.

FONTS

The font color in your design should primarily ensure readability and accessibility, while also complementing the overall color palette. While maroon can be used as an accent color, it is generally not recommended for large blocks of text because it can strain the eyes and reduce readability, especially against certain backgrounds.

Here’s how you can choose font colors for your 60-30-10 color palette (light gray, navy blue, and maroon):

Font Color Recommendations
1. Primary Font Color
Dark Gray (#333333 or #2C3E50)

Use this for most of your text (e.g., body text, descriptions).

Dark gray provides excellent contrast against a light gray background and is easy to read.

2. Secondary Font Color
Navy Blue (#2C3E50 or #34495E)

Use this for headings, subheadings, or labels.

Navy blue complements the secondary color in your palette and adds visual hierarchy.

3. Accent Font Color
Maroon (#800000 or #8B0000)

Use this sparingly for emphasis, such as:

Links or buttons (e.g., "Vote Now").

Important labels or icons.

Highlighted text or call-to-action elements.

Avoid using maroon for large blocks of text, as it can be hard to read.

Example Usage
1. Light Gray Background
Primary Text: Dark gray (#333333)

Secondary Text: Navy blue (#2C3E50)

Accent Text: Maroon (#800000) for buttons or links.

2. Navy Blue Background
Primary Text: White (#FFFFFF)

Secondary Text: Light gray (#F5F5F5)

Accent Text: Maroon (#800000) for buttons or icons.

3. Maroon Background
Primary Text: White (#FFFFFF)

Secondary Text: Light gray (#F5F5F5)

Accent Text: Gold (#FFD700) or another high-contrast color for buttons or icons.

Accessibility Considerations
Contrast Ratio: Ensure the contrast between text and background meets accessibility standards (at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify contrast ratios.

Avoid Pure Black: Pure black text on a white background can be harsh. Use dark gray instead for better readability.

Avoid Low Contrast: For example, maroon text on a navy blue background would have poor contrast and be hard to read.

Conclusion
For a voting system, use dark gray or navy blue for most of your text to ensure readability. Reserve maroon for accent elements like buttons or links, where it can add visual interest without compromising usability. Always prioritize accessibility and contrast to create a user-friendly design. Let me know if you need further assistance!
